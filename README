# Goals of Anpix:

To make a cross-distrobox package manager just like APX from Vanilla OS, 
I haven't forked anything and am making it from scratch as a side project/hobby project. 
It's written in Python and shell, and it's in ther future gonna be written in rust.

1. Make it "cross" Distrobox compatible.
2. Keep it small and not bloated.
3. Make it easy to install.
4. Make the host package manager work with it (starting with Debian).
5. Make it easily configurable/customizable.
